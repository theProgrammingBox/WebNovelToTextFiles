add file chaptersCompleted.txt to your project

add file .env to your project, add:
NOVEL_CHAPTER_URL = https://someHost/somePath/novelName/chapter- (what ever the url looks like without the chapter number. You may need to alter index.js to handle your url correctly)
NOVEL_URL = https://someHost/somePath/novelName (this is the url of the novel or where ever you need to go to to find the latest chapter number and novel name)

Play around with the numberOfProcesses variable in index.js because having too many can cause an error. But having more makes everything faster.

To reset all the chapters you have documented, clear the contents of chaptersCompleted.txt, delete all the txt files in the textFiles folder, and run the script again.
